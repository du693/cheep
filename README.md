# Cheep

With Cheep, you can document your sightings and view a detailed map filled with contributions from users all over New England. Ideal for both casual bird enthusiasts and serious birdwatchers, our app offers a clear and concise platform for tracking and sharing avian sightings. Dive in and enrich our collective understanding of local bird populations. Join today and contribute to a comprehensive bird spotting network.


## Overview

Cheep is a dynamic web application developed to showcase my current level of skill in web development. I really liked the idea of making an app that gives people another reason to go outside, similar to pokemonGo, so I decided on bird watching.

In this README, I provide an overview of Cheep's current capabilities and insights into its development. The project serves as a testament to my proficiency in web development and my current level of knowledge on web development, and ability create engaging and interactive applications.

## Acknowledgments

In developing Cheep I incorporated BirdNET, a tool designed for avian species recognition through acoustic analysis, available on GitHub. BirdNET, created by Stefan Kahl, Connor M. Wood, Maximilian Eibl, and Holger Klinck, enhances the app's ability to identify bird species from audio recordings. This integration significantly aids in connecting app users with bird identification. For the use of BirdNET in my project, I acknowledge the original work as follows:
