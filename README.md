## Acknowledgments

In developing Cheep, I incorporated BirdNET, a tool designed for avian species recognition through acoustic analysis, available on GitHub. BirdNET, created by Stefan Kahl, Connor M. Wood, Maximilian Eibl, and Holger Klinck, enhances the app's ability to identify bird species from audio recordings. This integration significantly aids in connecting app users with bird identification. For the use of BirdNET in my project, I acknowledge the original work as follows:
